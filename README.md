# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction

To predict the delivery time of food in real time, we need to calculate the distance between where the food is prepared and where it is consumed. After determining the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location, we need to find the relationship between the time it took the delivery partner to deliver the same distance in the past. 

So, for this task, we need a dataset that contains data about how long it takes a delivery partner to deliver groceries from a restaurant to a delivery location. I found an ideal dataset with all the features for this task.
